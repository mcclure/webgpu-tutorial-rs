Note this code reuses code from the wgpu project's "hello-triangle" example. Based on "fair use" principles (the small amount of code used and the basic universality of that code) and statements by the wgpu project (https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/issues/3769#issuecomment-1549963701) that the sample code is meant to be reused without conditions, I believe the wgpu project's license does not apply to this code reuse.
